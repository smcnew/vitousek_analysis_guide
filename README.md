This will be our read-me document to outline the purpose of this repository 

This repository is meant to accomplish two things:

1. Serve as a blank template that can be copied to start a new project. The idea is that you can copy the entire repository structure and repurpose it for your own project with your own data and scripts etc, but keep the overall structure in terms of file organization and coding the same.

2. Compile a bunch of recommendations on suggested practices and tips for things that work well in our lab with links to additional information.


#FAQs: 

1. How do I download this to my computer? 
- Actually I don't know.
