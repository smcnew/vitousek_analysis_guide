# ANALYSIS CHECKLIST:
A to-do list before you submit for publication

## Data cleaning and organization 
- [ ] My R and Rstudio are up to date
- [ ] The raw data are available and locked 
- [ ] I filtered and subsetted my data using programming, not excel
- [ ] I did basic data exploration to check for outliers and errors (e.g. following Zuur 2010)

## Data analysis
- [ ] I wrote down a plan for how to approach analysis (including a priori hypotheses) 
- [ ] I visualized relationships between key variables 
- [ ] I used appropriate statistical tests to test for significance among key varaibles

## Data reproducibility 
- [ ] I can run my analysis from start to finish from a clean workspace 
- [ ] The code is well-commented
- [ ] I have printed my session info so I know what packages and versions I used 

## Verification by analysis partner
- [ ] The analysis can be run from start to finish on a different computer by a different person
- [ ] The code is well-commented and readable (recognizing we all have our own style!) 
- [ ] At least one of the main results can be produced independently in analysis and figure by the analysis partner
